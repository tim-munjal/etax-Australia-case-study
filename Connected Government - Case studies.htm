<H1 id=start>Forget the paper trail - Working together allows clients to access 
their information electronically and automatically update their e-tax 
return</H1>
<H2>Objectives</H2>
<P>The Australian Taxation Office is the Australian Government’s principal 
revenue collection agency. Its role is to manage and shape tax, excise and 
superannuation systems that fund services for Australians. The Tax Office has an 
electronic relationship with over 9.1 million Australian taxpayers, including 
1.37 million Australians who lodged their return via e-tax in 2005. The Tax 
Office first released e-tax to the public in 1999. Feedback from early e-tax 
users indicated that they expected to be provided with information that they had 
previously supplied to the Tax Office (such as name and address details). Users 
also expected to be allowed the opportunity to validate the information that was 
provided. Similarly, users did suggest that information that is available to the 
Tax Office from other government agencies could be made available for inclusion 
in the e-tax returns.&nbsp; In 2002, the Tax Office began their <EM>Listening to 
the Community</EM> program, and in response, in 2003 developed the <I>Easier, 
Cheaper and more Personalised </I>program – continuously designing and testing 
changes to tax administration.</P>
<P>Medicare Australia plays an integral role in the Australian health sector. 
Its objective is to assist in improving health outcomes in Australia.&nbsp; Net 
medical expenses can be claimed as a tax offset if they exceed the necessary 
threshold.&nbsp; The usual processes involve accepting requests for net medical 
expense information, having these printed and sent to taxpayers.&nbsp; Given 
this information is only really needed to complete a tax return bringing these 
processes together appeared to have some benefits. Medicare Australia as part of 
their business objective of ‘delivering excellent customer service’ was willing 
to establish a secure interface to enable people to access their medical 
expenses information electronically. This electronic interface was set up to 
replace or reduce the existing paper process where requests for this information 
have been processed and provided over the counter or mailed to the individual 
for inclusion in their tax return. Annually 100,000 requests are handled by 
Medicare Australia, this can involve over 380,000 mail out items.</P>
<P>Experience has shown the Tax Office that some taxpayers don’t turn their 
minds to the need to keep tax related records such as net medical expenses until 
they start completing their income tax return. For e-tax users this means they 
will have to stop their “on-line” return while they wait for further information 
to complete their records. In some cases taxpayers have lodged their tax return 
with the incomplete data. They would then acquire the additional information and 
have to lodge an amended tax return. There is currently a cost to the Tax Office 
to process any amendment requests lodged via individuals. The introduction of an 
electronic interface between the Tax Office and Medicare Australia may reduce 
the number of amendment requests sent to the Tax Office that ultimately should 
lead to a reduction in overall processing costs for the office. </P>
<P>In 2003, the Tax Office and Medicare Australia agreed to undertake an initial 
pilot in the 2004 calendar year with a number of users, selection based on 
previous interactions with the Tax Office. The pilot allowed users to gain 
electronic access to their Medicare tax statement data which assisted their 
completion of the net medical expenses data section of their tax return. The 
users who agreed to participate in the pilot were sent instructions and an 
individual password. This password allowed them to access online directly from 
the e-tax application their net medical expenses data provided by Medicare 
Australia. The trial proved very successful from a user perspective, although it 
did raise the issue of scalability.&nbsp; </P>
<P>While it was recognised by both agencies that the client would be the main 
beneficiary, the initial cost estimates to implement a full production solution, 
identified that the existing Medicare Australia business model was prohibitively 
expensive for the perceived mutual benefit, as it would not be feasible to 
allocate a unique password to all taxpayers on an annual basis. The costs and 
the source of funds also led to further discussion as to who was getting the 
benefit – an important consideration from a budget perspective. So another 
method to authenticate the taxpayers and their relationship to the Medicare data 
had to be devised. The identification and authentication required by each agency 
were different, and a number of models were proposed. After consultation between 
both agencies a preferred solution was agreed upon. </P>
<P>By reviewing the design objectives and agreeing some constraints such as 
value for money, a more cost effective solution was developed.&nbsp; The 
solution satisfies the Medicare authentication and consent requirements, but 
rather than modifying the core Medicare model, the process development occurred 
within the Tax Office software and infrastructure.&nbsp; The solution will be 
deployed and all e-tax users will be able to populate their return with their 
Medicare expense details from July 2006.&nbsp; </P>
<P>Following the success of the Medicare Australia pilot, consideration was 
given by the Tax Office to other information that might be retrieved 
electronically to assist clients with the preparation of their income tax 
returns.&nbsp; A pilot initiative between the Tax Office and Centrelink in 2005 
allowed customers to have the option to receive a more seamless service from 
both agencies.</P>
<P>Centrelink delivers a range of services to the community including assisting 
people to become more self-sufficient and to improve their chances of finding 
employment.&nbsp; Many of the support payments provided by Centrelink are 
classed as taxable income and need to be included in annual tax returns. </P>
<P>After verifying their identity using a common identifier, in this case the 
Tax File Number (TFN), Centrelink customers who choose to use e-tax are able to 
retrieve and populate the relevant sections of e-tax with their payment summary 
data.&nbsp; This eliminates the need for them to enter the data from the hard 
copy payment summary and reduces the likelihood of transcription errors or 
omissions. The overall reduction in processing time means that those who are 
entitled to a tax refund may receive their refund more quickly.&nbsp; </P>
<P>In June and July every year, Centrelink receives a significant number of over 
the counter and phone requests for early or duplicate for payment 
summaries.&nbsp; As more customers elect to use e-tax, many of these additional 
contacts will be eliminated, freeing staff to deal with other customer 
enquiries.&nbsp; </P>
<P>Customer feedback from the pilot indicated a high level of customer 
satisfaction with e-tax in general and very positive comments about the 
availability of pre-populated Centrelink data. Further enhancements by the end 
of the 2007 financial year will simplify the data transfer process.</P>
<P>From 2006 e-tax users will be able to pre-populate information from both 
Medicare Australia and Centrelink directly to their e-tax return, which will 
reduce the time to complete a return and reduce the amount of paper needed to 
complete an e-tax return.</P>
<P>The Tax Office has also worked with Centrelink to implement the 30% child 
care tax rebate initiative announced in the 2004 government election. In 2006 
e-tax users will be able to download Centrelink information to assist them when 
making a claim for the 30% child care tax rebate.</P>
<P>The Tax Office is currently implementing a pilot solution where people can 
download bank interest and managed funds data from selected institutions. In 
future years the Tax Office may look to pre-populate information from share 
registries.</P>

<H2>Key Findings</H2>
<P>The win-win-win element in each project is essential for overall 
success.&nbsp; In this case a win for the client, in time savings and increased 
convenience, and a win for each agency through cost savings and enhanced 
customer service delivery.</P>
<P>A key factor for multi-agency project success is to collectively agree on 
outcomes of the project for each agency so that all parties are working to a 
common shared goal.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Agreement of outcomes, intent, assumptions 
and constraints is essential at the beginning of a project to ensure the project 
remains focussed on shared outcomes. It is important to take the time at the 
beginning of the project to clearly communicate to all participants the common 
messages from a managerial, business and technical level.&nbsp; Throughout the 
project lifecycle revisit the process outcomes to ensure that developments 
continue to meet the original objectives.</P>
<P>&nbsp; While it is not always the case, in this project the initial costing 
constraints led to a review of the solution which in turn led to a better 
overall outcome.&nbsp; </P>
<P>Multi-agency projects can lead to further avenues for working collaboratively 
that not only enhance existing projects but through establishing relationships 
allow new ways of working together on innovations.</P>
